//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Games of Throne", "Expendable", "Wictcher"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0]; 
// console.log(firstMovie);
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let lengArry = movies.length
//console.log(lengArry);
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
// let lastElement = movies[2];
let lastElement = movies [movies.length - 1]
console.log(lastElement);
